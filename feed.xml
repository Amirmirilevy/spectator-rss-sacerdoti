  <title>It didn’t take long to forget the lessons of the Holocaust</title>
  <link>https://spectator.com/article/what-did-jews-do-wrong/</link>
  <description>Life expectancy across Europe is 81 years. An 81-year-old European dying today would have been born on the day Auschwitz was liberated. It has taken one average European lifetime for us to forget the lessons of the Shoah. How many Jews do you think there are in the world? Out of 8.1 billion people alive</description>

  <title>How Israel did the impossible – and brought the hostages home</title>
  <link>https://spectator.com/article/how-israel-did-the-impossible-and-brought-the-hostages-home/</link>
  <description>On 25 October 2023, speaking as Israel prepared to expand its ground campaign in Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly and unambiguously set out Israel’s two central war aims: the destruction of Hamas and the return of all the hostages the Palestinians had taken into Gaza. It was the first time he set out</description>

  <title>The US plan for Gaza is absurd</title>
  <link>https://spectator.com/article/americas-plan-for-gaza-is-absurd/</link>
  <description>Donald Trump’s strangely artificial Board of Peace event in Davos on Thursday looked like a Hollywood rendering of an international summit. Everything was too slick, faintly uncanny. Like an AI-generated image, it was photo-real yet failed the most basic human glance test. Too perfect. No wabi-sabi. The first tell was visual: the set, complete with</description>

  <title>What good will Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ do?</title>
  <link>https://spectator.com/article/is-donald-trump-making-the-middle-east-more-dangerous/</link>
  <description>The Middle East has entered a phase where events no longer necessarily resolve into outcomes. They pause, harden, and then reappear elsewhere. Ceasefires freeze wars without settling them. New councils are announced before their purpose is fully explored or revealed. Violence recedes in one arena and resurfaces in another. What looks like diplomacy is often</description>

  <title>What the Iranian uprising means for the Middle East</title>
  <link>https://spectator.com/article/the-middle-east-is-once-again-in-flux/</link>
  <description>The Middle East has long been organised around two competing logics: pragmatic alignment and ideological alignment. Before the 7 October war, these logics produced two regional blocs that structured most political, diplomatic and security behaviour. The Palestinian attack and invasion that triggered the war ruptured both systems. Incentives shifted, alliances frayed, and assumptions collapsed. What</description>

  <title>Saudi Arabia and the UAE’s proxy war in Yemen</title>
  <link>https://spectator.com/article/saudi-arabia-and-the-uaes-proxy-war-in-yemen/</link>
  <description>The escalation that emerged overnight in southern Yemen did not originate on the battlefield but in a relatively quiet logistical operation. It began with the arrival of two ships carrying weapons and military vehicles from the United Arab Emirates, docking at the port of Mukalla in Hadramawt. The cargo was unloaded without coordination with the</description>

  <title>We need to talk about Islam</title>
  <link>https://spectator.com/article/we-need-to-talk-about-islam/</link>
  <description>I did not come to Islam through theology. I came to it through fear, threat and hatred directed at me and the world I live in. I think the first time I became aware of something called Islam was in 1989, when Salman Rushdie was sentenced to death by Iran’s ‘Supreme Leader’ for writing his</description>

  <title>Why is Alaa Abd el-Fattah's return a 'top priority' for Keir Starmer?</title>
  <link>https://spectator.com/article/why-is-alaa-abd-el-fattahs-return-a-top-priority-for-keir-starmer/</link>
  <description>Apparently it has been a “top priority” for Keir Starmer and his government, since the moment they came to office, to return Alaa Abd el-Fattah to the United Kingdom. A man granted British citizenship only in December 2021. A man who had previously described Britons as “british dogs and monkeys”, who wrote that he “rejoice[s]</description>

  <title>Iran has a ceaseless obsession with Israel</title>
  <link>https://spectator.com/article/irans-obsession-with-israel-is-ceaseless/</link>
  <description>When Benjamin Netanyahu arrives in Florida at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in a few days’ time, near the top of his agenda will be a sober accounting of Iranian military activity and what it may yet presage. He will brief the President on a sustained sequence of Iranian ballistic-missile drills conducted across multiple regions, the</description>

  <title>The crackdown on 'globalise the intifada' chants is too little, too late</title>
  <link>https://spectator.com/article/the-police-crackdown-on-globalise-the-intifada-chants-is-too-little-too-late/</link>
  <description>Protesters chanting ‘globalise the intifada’ will now be arrested, according to the heads of Greater Manchester Police and the Metropolitan Police. The announcement has been framed as a response to a ‘changed context’. But what it actually represents is an admission, belated and heavy, that the authorities spent years refusing to see what was directly</description>

  <title>Why won’t the West defend Jews?</title>
  <link>https://spectator.com/article/why-cant-the-west-defend-jews/</link>
  <description>Bondi Beach is not occupied territory. Yet a Jewish celebration there ended in blood. It is not within a military zone, not contested land, not an ‘open air prison’, but still, among civilians, on a day marked for celebration, Jews were once again slaughtered, picked off by a Muslim father and son who were motivated</description>

  <title>For Jews, the Bondi beach shooting is grimly recognisable</title>
  <link>https://spectator.com/article/the-horror-of-the-bondi-beach-shooting/</link>
  <description>The attack at Bondi beach during a Hanukkah celebration, killing nine, has sent a fresh wave of horror through the Jewish diaspora. What might once have been regarded as unthinkable – a targeted assault on a Jewish gathering in the heart of a peaceful, democratic society – has now become grimly recognisable. It must be</description>

  <title>Piers Morgan fell into Nick Fuentes’s trap</title>
  <link>https://spectator.com/article/piers-morgan-fell-into-nick-fuentess-trap/</link>
  <description>When Michael Gove introduced me to Piers Morgan last week at the Spectator Christmas reception, Morgan seized my hand and beamed, ‘I know Jonathan. We’re old friends.’ This was generous of him, not least because it isn’t true. We’d met once before, briefly. But some months earlier I had written a critique of his YouTube show</description>

  <title>The BBC's anti-Semitism training is an offensive parody</title>
  <link>https://spectator.com/article/the-bbcs-antisemitism-training-is-an-offensive-parody/</link>
  <description>The BBC has unveiled its compulsory training course for all staff on how not to be racist to Jews. I completed the online module and found it laughable, feeble and entirely beside the point. This isn’t education. It’s parody. A cartoonish exercise in HR-driven pseudo-virtue, dressed up as moral instruction. I have written before that</description>

  <title>Marwan Barghouti isn't the 'Palestinian Mandela'</title>
  <link>https://spectator.com/article/marwan-barghouti-isnt-the-palestinian-mandela/</link>
  <description>Some scoffed when Donald Trump thought to tap Tony Blair’s decades of involvement in the Middle East for his future plans in Gaza. Perhaps they were right to. But not to worry: the global search for strategic wisdom has now been resolved. The path to peace lies not through seasoned statesmen or regional experts, but</description>

  <title>Nigel Farage must come clean about his Dulwich College schooldays</title>
  <link>https://spectator.com/article/nigel-farage-must-come-clean-about-his-dulwich-college-schooldays/</link>
  <description>The allegations concerning Nigel Farage’s conduct as a schoolboy have returned with unusual force, not because the country is suddenly preoccupied with the internal sociology of Dulwich College, but because Farage now leads a party that sits at the centre of the national debate. Any claim about his past, however old and recycled, is inevitably</description>

  <title>The revelations about what the Gaza hostages suffered are the most painful yet</title>
  <link>https://spectator.com/article/its-time-to-listen-to-the-stories-of-the-gaza-hostages/</link>
  <description>The Israeli hostages recently freed from Gaza have begun to speak, and among the new revelations is that some were subjected to sexual assault and degradation, including male hostages. They describe being stripped, groped, violated, and threatened at gunpoint. The scale and cruelty of what they endured should have triggered sustained, front-page attention in the</description>

  <title>A lethal standoff is playing out deep beneath Gaza</title>
  <link>https://spectator.com/article/a-lethal-standoff-is-playing-out-deep-beneath-gaza/</link>
  <description>In 1929, René Magritte painted a picture that has since become iconic in both art and philosophy. The Treachery of Images depicts a finely detailed tobacco pipe with a caption beneath: Ceci n’est pas une pipe – ‘This is not a pipe’. Magritte’s point is subtle and enduring. It is indeed not a pipe, but an</description>

  <title>What Trump's Gaza peace plan means for Israel</title>
  <link>https://spectator.com/article/what-trumps-gaza-peace-plan-means-for-israel/</link>
  <description>This may not be the conclusion Israel imagined when it launched its campaign in Gaza. Not all the hostage bodies are home. Hamas is bruised, but not broken. The region remains volatile. Yet even as combat continues, the United Nations Security Council, backed by an American administration long assumed to be ‘pro-Israel’, yesterday endorsed a</description>
